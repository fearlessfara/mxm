MultiThread Matrix Multiplication

![alt text](http://minefree.altervista.org/mxm.gif)<br>
Optimized matrix multiplication can also be done using BLAS libraries (which are written in fortran, a mathematical-scientific language which has different memory structures that allow a particular kind of optimization in dealing with matrices.<br>By the way this programme is meant to be a machine independant version of the software and because of the fact that BLAS is pretty hard to install and also pretty machine/hardware dependant I've preferred to create my own version of the optimized matrix multiplication algorithm/program using posix threads (which sould work on any modern operative system (macOS, windows and unix-like).
